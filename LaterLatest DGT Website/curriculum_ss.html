                        <div class="underHeaderText"><p>Space is pretty cool. I’m sure we can all agree on this fact 
                            - but it seems that the vast majority of people have no idea what kind of weird and wonderful
                             things lie behind the veil of darkness that cover them from our pesky eyes. Things like planets,
                              stars, black holes, nebulae, quasars, pulsars, binary systems - the list is practically endless.
                               In this lesson we’ll be taking a look at some of the awesome things in space, and some of the 
                               phenomena that can be caused as a result of them. We’ll be looking at planets and how they can
                                orbit around a point that doesn’t actually exist, black holes and how they can redirect photons,
                                 and the speed of light and how it allows real-life ‘time travel’ to actually be a possibility.

                            <br><br>Planets. We all know what they are. Giant balls of rock, ice, minerals, and maybe water or 
                            even life if you’re considering Earth. Just like spacecraft, all of the planets and moons in our solar
                             system, as well as our Sun itself, have their own orbits. Whether that be around the center of the galaxy,
                              around our Sun, or around one of the planets. When it comes to Earth, we all know that, in orbit some
                               300 thousand kilometers away, the Moon resides. If we look at the physics in regards to our lonely
                                little friend out in the distance, we can see that the center of mass of the Moon is… well,
                                 directly in the center of the Moon. In regards to Earth, the same is true - the center of mass
                                  is present directly in the middle of our blue planet. However - when considering <i> multiple </i>
                                   celestial bodies at once, the center of mass of the entire <i> system </i> is not in the center
                                    of either planet! Based on the mass of either planet, the center of mass existing between the
                                     two planets will shift. The more massive the planet, the closer the center of mass will be
                                      to its center. Imagine it as a game of cosmic tug-of-war! Each planet is trying to pull
                                       the center of mass towards itself, but can only pull with its own weight. When it comes
                                        to the Earth-Moon system, the center of mass is actually 1700km under the surface of 
                                        the Earth, due to Earth’s huge mass compared to the Moon’s. When it comes to two
                                         celestial bodies with the SAME center of mass, however, they will be ‘tugging’ at
                                          equal strength, meaning the center of mass will be <i> directly in the middle of
                                               them, in space! </i>. The coolest part is that it’s around this point that
                                                both of the bodies will orbit! When it comes to real life, Pluto’s moon 
                                                is almost as big as it is, and thus their combined center of mass is in
                                             the middle of absolutely nowhere - yet the two planets still orbit around
                                              this point as if it wasn’t at least a <i> little </i> weird. (See the gif for more clarification)

They break the laws of physics when entered, they bend light in unimaginable ways, and, as we will discuss later, they can facilitate real life time travel if approached. When it comes to light, however, black holes are very interesting. You may not think it, but black holes can be some of the <b> brightest </b> things in the entire universe! This is because as they consume stellar matter (they eat stars), the remnants of the star, being hot plasma, swirl around the black hole at untold speeds, and may take an extremely long time to fall into the chasm in the center. Despite all the horror stories told about black holes, they really aren’t as bad as people might make them seem. There’s a lot of speculation that one might ‘fall into a black hole’, however this is about on par with falling directly into the Sun - you’d need to have zero velocity!
                            Speaking of velocity, though, light - the fastest thing in the universe, gets distorted simply from passing by a black hole. Black holes have the highest gravity of any known object in the entire universe, and thus have the ability to move photons around like it’s nothing. This effect is referred to as ‘gravitational lensing’, and you might be surprised to hear that things such as our own Sun do it too, albeit on a much, much smaller scale.

Time travel is seen by almost everyone to be completely impossible, but the reality is that it isn’t! Before we begin, I should break the sad news that going <i>back</i> in time, for the foreseeable future, is completely impossible. However, when it comes to black holes and the speed of light, there are some wacky things that can happen when you get too close to the limits of the universe… In order to understand this concept, you will need to be introduced to Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity, which states that, regardless of the velocity of a given observer, light will appear to move at the same speed. When it comes to ‘normal’ physics, if you were riding a bike at, say, 5km/h, and a car sped past you at a blistering speed of 10km/h, relative to you that car is going only 5km/h. When it comes to the speed of light, though, regardless of your own speed, the observed speed of light will always be the same. I.e you can be going 5, 50, or even 5 million km/h, yet light will always appear to move the same speed. The connotations of this are that if you move fast enough, such as being in orbit of a black hole or somehow getting close to the speed of light itself, <i> time itself will slow down to ensure that light stays at the same speed relative to you. </i> Woah. <br><br><b id="link" onclick="window.location='./curriculum_eng.html';">Next Course</b><br><br><h6>Image Credit: Wikipedia, Flikr, iStock</h6></p></div>
