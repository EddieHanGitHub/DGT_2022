                            They’re really great - 
                            they light up the sky as they 
                            shoot off into the heavens (whether successful or not), 
                            are a gateway into the stars, and sometimes just look super 
                            dang cool. However, have you ever wondered what makes
                             them ‘tick’? I certainly have! In this lesson,
                              I will be discussing exactly what makes a 
                              rocket work. We will be going over topics 
                              such as orientation in space, propellant, 
                              and finally, the crazy ‘emergency ejection 
                              systems’ built into many launch vehicles. Through 
                              all of these topics, a basic understanding of 
                              engineering in relation to spacecraft components 
                              will (hopefully) be obtained, in preparation 
                              for the next lesson. 

                            <br><br>Spacecraft orientation systems! What are they?
                             How do they work? What kinds are there? All spacecraft
                              need to orientate themselves somehow, at least if they
                               want to reach their intended destination. Through many
                                different components, they can feasibly achieve this
                                 goal. One of the ways that spacecraft can move around
                                  is through the use of reaction wheels. Reaction wheels
                                   are a type of component generally used to orient
                                    smaller spacecraft, usually small satellites, when
                                     there is no atmosphere to manipulate through components
                                      such as fins. Reaction wheels work through a spinning
                                       wheel that’s attached to a brushless electric motor.
                                        Through the principle of conservation of momentum,
                                         reaction wheels generate torque, which in turn moves
                                          the spacecraft! Reaction wheels can become quite large,
                                           but sometimes, more power is necessary. In this case,
                                            RCS thrusters may be used. RCS thrusters are small 
                                            blocks with many tiny thrusters pointing in all directions.
                                             The purpose of these thrusters is to expel high pressure
                                              gas in order to move the spacecraft in the opposite direction.
                                               This occurs due to Newton’s third law (any action will
                                                result in an equal and opposite reaction), and means that
                                                 the rocket will always move in the opposite direction that
                                                  the thrust is being expelled out of. Spacecraft orientation
                                                   systems may be helpful during ascent to keep the rocket stable,
                                                    re-entry to prevent sensitive parts from burning up, and in
                                                     complex orbital maneuvers that require the spacecraft
                                                      to be facing in a specific direction with fine accuracy.

                        <div class="ImgText"><p>Spaceships have long been known for their fiery departures into deep space, but what’s actually behind the smoke and the flames? Well, the short answer is <i> propellant. </i> Rockets can use many different kinds of propellant in order to get them to their destinations - from conventional propellants that need to be mixed and then ignited, to hypergolic propellants that immediately combust upon touching certain other chemicals, to solid fuels, which need to be lit, and will subsequently explode out thousands of tons of superheated material and gas. Different types of propellants have different uses - for example, because solid fuel cannot be turned off once ignited, unlike regular liquid fuels, it’s generally used in the first stage of a spacecraft in order to get it off the ground, and then jettisoned. Liquid fuel is the most common type of propellant, as it can be stopped multiple times - this allows for more precise control over exactly where the spacecraft is headed. Exotic fuels, such as xenon gas, are used to power extremely efficient engines (ion engines). Xenon gas is only ever used in spacecraft that are already in space, as, despite it taking extremely long to deplete and being able to give unfathomably large velocity boosts to spacecraft, the engine can take weeks, if not <i>months</i> to reach the desired velocity!

                            Sometimes things go wrong - and at times, they can go <i> very wrong </i> - but what happens if they do, and there are people on board the spacecraft? Surely they’re not just left to their fate. No, definitely not! This is where launch escape systems come in! If your rocket is about to blow up, light off the engines and off you go! Launch escape thrusters are systems that are generally incorporated into most crewed spacecraft in order to avoid serious harm or death during unfortunate situations. They are designed to propel the crew up and away from the malfunctioning spacecraft, and to ensure they land a safe distance away from the carnage. There are many types of LES, but the most common are tower escape systems. These work through solid rocket motors, which are ignited and produce an extremely large amount of thrust to pull the capsule away from the rocket. When the solid fuel runs out, the LES is jettisoned and the parachutes of the capsule open, with astronauts inside that are very much still alive. SpaceX, through their ‘Crew Dragon’ capsule, have brought another form of LES to the spotlight. In the Dragon capsule, small thruster ports are specially built into the bottom half, and are fueled using traditional liquid propellant mixtures. This allows the LES to perfectly calculate the amount of thrust needed, and carry the astronauts on board to safety without jeopardizing their sanity or their lives.
